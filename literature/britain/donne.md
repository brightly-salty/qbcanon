A [British](../index.html) author of many "Holy Sonnets".

### "Death, be not proud"

"Rest and sleep" are mere "pictures" of death. "Some have called" death "Mighty and dreadful" but "thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desparate men."

### "Batter my heart, three-personed God"

He compares himself to "an usurp'd town to another due" and complains that he's "betrothed unto your enemy."
