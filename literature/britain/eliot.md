### "The Waste Land"

It is dedicated to "il miglior fabbro", an epithet taken from Dante. "April is the cruelest month" begins the poem. Its five sections include "The Burial of the Dead", "The Fire Sermon" and "What the Thunder Said". It ends with the Sanskrit words "Shantih shantih shantih." Its last section asks "Who is the third who walks always beside you?" Its second secution is repeatedly punctuated by the all-caps line "HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME." It was drastically cut from an early version called "He Do the Police in Different Voices" and was heavily reshaped by Ezra Pound.
