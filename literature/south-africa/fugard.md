### Master Harold...and the Boys

Tea Room in Port Elizabeth. Willie and Sam practice for a ballroom dancing competition. Hally shows up and doesn't like his dad. Talks about a tomato box kite, the knockout of Max Schmeling, a world without collisions. His alcoholic, one legged father is returning from the hospital. "Little Man, you've had a busy day" is played.
