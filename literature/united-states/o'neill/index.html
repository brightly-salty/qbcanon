            <p>An <a href="../">American</a> author.</p>
<h3 id="long-days-journey-into-night">Long Day’s Journey Into Night</h3>
<p>It centers on Edmund and the rest of the Tyrone family, but it’s really an autobiographical account of the dysfunction of O’Neill’s own family, set on one day in August 1912. The father is a miserly actor, while the mother is a morphine addict, and the brother is a drunk; they argue and cut each other down throughout the play.</p>
<p>O’Neill wrote it fifteen years earlier than 1956 and presented the manuscript to his third wife with instructions that it not be produced until 25 years after his death, but it was actually produced three years after he died.</p>
<h3 id="mourning-becomes-electra">Mourning Becomes Electra</h3>
<p>Really a trilogy, consisting of “Homecoming”, “The Hunted”, and “The Haunted”. Though it is set in post-Civil War New England, O’Neill used Aeschylus’s tragedy The Orestesia as the basis for the plot. Lavinia Mannon desires revenge against her mother, Christine, who with the help of her lover Adam Brant has poisoned Lavinia’s father Ezra; Lavinia persuades her brother Orin to kill Brant. A distressed Christine commits suicide, and, after Orin and Lavinia flee to the South Seas. Orin cannot stand the guilt and kills himself as well, leaving Lavinia in the house alone.</p>
<h3 id="the-iceman-cometh">The Iceman Cometh</h3>
<p>A portrait of drunkenness and hopeless dreams. Regular patrons of the End of the Line Café anticipate the annual arrival of Theodore “Hickey” Hickman, but in 1912 he returns to them sober. After the patrons reveal their “pipe dreams,” Hickey implores them to give up those dreams and lead productive lives. The “Iceman” is supposed to represent the “death” found in reality.</p>
