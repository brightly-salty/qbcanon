### Our Town

Takes place in the village of Grover's Corners, New Hampshire just after the turn of the 20th century. It's divided into three acts: "Daily Life" (Professor Willard and Editor Webb gossip on the everyday lives of town residents), "Love and Marriage" (Emily Webb and George Gibbs fall in love and marry) and "Death" (Emily dies while giving birth, and her spirit converses about the meaning of life with other dead people in the cemetery). A Stage Manager talks to the audience and serves as a narrator throughout the drama, which is performed on a bare stage.
