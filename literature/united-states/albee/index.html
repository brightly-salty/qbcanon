            <h1>Edward Albee</h1>
            <p>An <a href="../">American</a> author.</p>
<h3 id="whos-afraid-of-virginia-woolf">Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</h3>
<p>The author Virginia Woolf has little to do with the story, except that Martha sings the title to George when she is mad at him in Act I. In fact, Albee got the title from graffiti he saw on a men’s room wall.</p>
<p>George is a professor who married Martha, the college president’s daughter, but the two dislike each other. Martha invites another couple, the instructor Nick and his wife Honey, for drinks after a party for her father. All four of them get drunk, and they end up bickering over their flawed marriages: besides George and Martha’s problems, Honey is barren, and Nick married her for her money.</p>
