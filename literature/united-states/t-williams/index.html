<p>Blanche DuBois and Stanley Kowalski represent Williams’s two visions of the South: declining “old romantic” vs the harsh modern era. Blanche is a Southern belle who lost the family estate, and is forced to move into her sister Stella’s New Orleans apartment. Stella’s husband Stanley is rough around the edges, but sees through Blanche’s artifice. He ruins Blanche’s chance to marry his friend Mitch by revealing to Mitch that Blanche was a prostitute. Then, after Blanche confronts Stanley, he rapes her, driving her into sanity.</p>
<p>The drama was developed into a movie, marking the breakthrough performance of method actor Marlon Brando.</p>

<p>Partly based on Williams’ own family, the drama is narrated by Tom Wingfield, who supports his mother Amanda and his crippled sister Laura (who takes refuge from reality in her glass animals). At Amanda’s insistence, Tom brings his friend Jim O’Connor to the house as a “gentleman caller” for Laura. While O’Connor is there, the horn on Laura’s glass unicorn breaks, bringing her into reality, until O’Connor tells the family that he is already engaged. Laura returns to her fantasy world, while Tom abandons the family after fighting with Amanda.</p>
