Felix is currently trying to calm his baby by singing a lullaby about a horse who wouldn't drink because its hooves were bleeding. He is rough on his horse and claims he's not. The Bride throws down orange blossoms and says a cold wind is moving through her. Leonardo shows up and talks to the Bride. Leonardo and the Bride obviously have something going on. The Bride and Leonardo have escaped on a horse. A bunch of woodcutters, the moon and an old beggar woman who represents death narrate the scene. The Bridegroom and Leonardo die.
