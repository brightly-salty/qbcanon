### The History of the Valorous and Wittie Knight-errant Don Quixote of the Mancha

Alonso Quijano reads chivalric romances and changes his name to Don Quixote de la Mancha to become a knight-errant. He loves Aldonza Lorenzo, who he renamed Dulcinea del Toboso. He acquires the squire Sancho Panza and the horse Rocinante. He thinks windmills are giants and sheep are armies. He meets Cardenio after freeing some galley slaves. He accuses a puppetmaster of consorting with the Devil due to his clairvoyant ape. After refusing to pay an innkeeper, Sancho Panzo is tossed in a blanket. Don Quixote returns home after losing to the Knight of the White Moon.
