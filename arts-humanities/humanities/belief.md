This is the homepage for the *Belief* category, a subcategory of the [Humanities](../index.html).

We have divided Belief content into eight main subcategories:

- [Abrahamic Belief](abrahamic/index.html)
- [Ancient Near Eastern Belief](ane/index.html)
- [East Asian Belief](east-asian/index.html)
- [European Belief](european/index.html)
- [Greek and Roman Mythology](mediterranean/index.html)
- [Modern Religions](modern/index.html)
- [Indigenous American Belief](american/index.html)
- [West Asian Belief](west-asian/index.html)

To read the sacred texts for themselves, [the Internet Sacred Text Archive](https://www.sacred-texts.com/index.htm) is an excellent resource.
