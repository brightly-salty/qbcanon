### Franz Boas

1858-1942. The father of modern and/or American anthropology. He was the first professor of anthropology at Columbia and taught a lot of famous people in the field: Ruth Benedict, Margaret Mead, Alfred Koeber, Zora Neal Hurston, etc. He conducted fieldwork on the Inuits of Baffin Island and the Kwaikiutl (now referred to as Kwakwaka'wakw) on Vancouver Island.

Franz Boas created the four-field approach, dividing anthropology into archaeology, linguistics, physical anthropology, and cultural anthropology ("stones", "tones", "bones", and "thrones"), because Boas believed cultures are too complex to be studied from a singular perspective.

Franz Boas's display of the Northwest Coast Indian Hall at the American Museum of Natural History reflects his philosophy of organizing artifacts by cultural area.

At the Chicago World's Fair, Boas made a model village for fourteen Kwakiutl from British Columbia.

Boas claimed that "if the willingness of man to suffer should disappear", then man would too.

Boas organized the Jessup North Pacific Expedition, sponsored by industrialist Morris Jesup, that investigated the peoples of the North Pacific for the American Museum of Natural History.

Boas traveled to Baffin Island to investigate the impact of the physical environment on native Inuit migrations. Boas erroneously claimed that the Inuit have an unusually high number of words for types of snow.

In the last chapter ("The Race Problem in Modern Society") of one Boas work, Boas decries "attempts to impress one pattern of thought upon whole nations".

In a book that questions the conception of the white race as culturally and physically superior, Boas dismissed concerns about racial purity as "imaginary" in a discussion of miscegenation.

In Boas' fieldwork on the Kwaikiutl people of Vancouver Island, he broke with Lewis Henry Morgan's theory of kinship. He concluded that human activity and thought must be understood in terms of the culture that originated them.

### Matti Bunzl

Franz Boas and the Humboldtian Tradition

### Auguste Comte

The founder of positivism and sociology. He argued that society develops through three stages: theocratic, metaphysical, and positive.

### Emile Durkheim

He was a French sociologist in the Positivist tradition, a student of Auguste Comte. He founded the journal L'annee sociologique He wanted to make sociology its own superior field of independent study because he believed that societies cannot be reduced to component parts. He created the concept of "collective effervescence" which is communities coming together and sharing thoughts and actions.

He debated Jacques Doleris on sex education, drawing on his theory that incest taboos came from primitive beliefs about the power of menstrual blood.

A central concept of Emile Durkheim's was *anomie*, which is a condition of social disintegration. *Anomie* is a state in which rules have lost authority and occurs when a society is in a state of drastic change; older societal norms fade and are not immediately replaced by new ones. In this state of normlessness, members of society are left confused and feeling outcast.

The Division of Labor in Society

- his doctoral dissertation, first major work
- explores the transition from primitive societies to industrial ones
  - the "dynamic density" of a group is the level of socialization within it
  - greater dynamic density is produced by an increase in population per area and degree of social interaction
  - greater dynamic density precipitates a move from organic solidarity to mechanical solidarity
- "primitive" homogenous societies exhibit "mechanical solidarity"
  - a cohesion between individuals based on their similarities, whether that be through kinship, familial ties, or religion
  - people socialize through, and social order is preseved by, homogeneity of lifestyle and work
- modern industrial societies exhibit "organic solidarity"
  - individuals are tied together by the interdependence caused by the division of labor
  - people socialize through and social order is preserved by workspaces
  - allows individualism to persist in complex societies
- distinguished between repressive law and restitutive law
  - in repressive law, crimes are punished by the communnity
  - in restitutive law, crimes are punished by the courts
  - used the Twelve Tables, the Hebrew Torah, and the laws of Christian Europe to argue that civilization's laws have moved from being repressive to restitutive
- urbanization weakened the power of guilds and increased the geographic span of political and economic institutions
- the "collective conscience" is the mass of knowledge and beliefs of average members of a society
- crime
  - crime was a normal part of "primitive" society in which people share a collective conscience
  - crime offends the states of the collective conscience
  - the punishment of crime attempts to maintain mechanical solidarity
  - crime "is only an anticipation of future morality - a step torward what will be"

Rules of the Sociological Method

- stressed the importance of having a specific object of study
- the object of study for sociology is "social facts"
- social facts
  - either normal (observed in majority of individuals) or pathological (observed in minority of individuals)
  - states of the collective mind"
  - consist of "manners of acting, thinking, and feeling eternal to the individual"
  - certain actions, objects, and beliefs (external characteristics) that gain "facticity" and become coercive forces on individuals
  - imposed on an individual from an outside source rather than the individual's own conscience
- emphasized that sociologists should "treat social facts as things"
- sociology must be brought into line as much as possible with the natural sciences by avoiding bias
- advocated a rigorously scientific approach

Suicide

- he studies suicide as a social fact
- helped standardize the sociological method
- observes that suicide is more prevalent among Protestants than Catholics and higher in peacetime than in wartime
- he divides the rationales for suicide into four categories
  - egoistic = individual does not feel fully integrated into society, "excessive individuation"
  - altruistic = individual's needs are subordinated to the needs of society, normlessness
  - anomie = individual has a lack of certainty and a sense of moral confusion about one's place in society
  - fatalistic = society is so excessively regulated that an individual would rather die than live in it
- other thinkers noticed a lack of the "question of art" in Suicide, which inspired Bataille and Derrida to note the "problem of the exxcess"
- concluded that Tarde's law of imitation did not sufficiently explain suicide
- deviance is a natural part of any society

The Elementary Forms of Religious Life

- explores religion sui generis, as a social phenomenon
- defines religion as beliefs and practices about the sacred, which creates a dichotomy of sacred and profane
- religion is the interrelation of sacred things
- uses the rituals and totemism of the Aborigine people of Australia as an example
- argues that religion developed from totemism when the items became sacred which then led to a conception of God
- in totemism, groups of people project the image of society on an object
- concluded that society annd the god that it worships are functionally equivalent
- defined God as "society writ large"
- distinguished between "beliefs", states of opinions, and "rites", determined modes of action
- theorizes that religion was a so-called "primordial matri" for culture, with collective representations
- beliefs should be evaluated according to the four criteria of volume, intensity, rigidity, and content
- examined the "collective effervescence" inherennt to communal behaviors that separated the sacred from everyday life
- identified the security of collective belief

On the Normality of Crime

- says Socrates' independence of thought rendered a service to humanity
- tiny trangressions would amount to deviance in a "society of saints"
- crime is normal
- functionalist argument that crime must eist in order to strengthenn thical norms
- crime is a social fact
