### Auguste Comte

The founder of positivism and sociology. He argued that society develops through three stages: theocratic, metaphysical, and positive.

### Emile Durkheim

He was a French sociologist in the Positivist tradition, a student of Auguste Comte. He wanted to make sociology its own superior field of independent study because he believed that societies cannot be reduced to component parts. He created the concept of "collective effervescence" which is communities coming together and sharing thoughts and actions.

A central concept of Emile Durkheim's was *anomie*, which is a condition of social disintegration. *Anomie* is a state in which rules have lost authority and occurs when a society is in a state of drastic change; older societal norms fade and are not immediately replaced by new ones. In this state of normlessness, members of society are left confused and feeling outcast.

On the Normality of Crime

- says Socrates' independence of thought rendered a service to humanity

The Division of Labor in Society

- his doctoral dissertation
- explores the transition from primitive societies to industrial ones
- says primitive societies exhibit "mechanical solidarity"
  - a cohesion between individuals based on their similarities, whether that be through kinship, familial ties, or religion
- says modern industrial societies exhibit "organic solidarity"
  - individuals are tied together by the interdependence caused by the division of labor

Rules of the Sociological Method

- stressed the importance of having a specific object of study
- the object of study for sociology is "social facts"
- social facts are either normal (observed in majority of individuals) or pathological (observed in minority of individuals)
- social facts are imposed on an individual from an outside source rather than the individual's own conscience.

Suicide

- he studies suicide as a social fact
- observes that suicide is more prevalent among Protestants than Catholics and higher in peacetime than in wartime
- he divides the rationales for suicide into four categories
  - egoistic = individual does not feel fully integrated into society, "excessive individuation"
  - altruistic = individual's needs are subordinated to the needs of society, normlessness
  - anomic = individual has a lack of certainty and a sense of moral confusion about one's place in society
  - fatalistic = society is so excessively regulated that an individual would rather die than live in it

The Elementary Forms of Religious Life

- explores religion as a social phenomenon
- uses the rituals of the Aborigine people of Australia as an example
- argues that religion developed from totemism when the items became sacred which then led to a conception of God
