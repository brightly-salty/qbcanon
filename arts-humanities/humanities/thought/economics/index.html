<h3 id="kenneth-arrow">Kenneth Arrow</h3>
<p>An American welfare economist that investigated the problems caused by asymmetric information in markets</p>
<p>Arrow replaced differential calculus with convex set methods in his proofs of the first and second welfare theorems.</p>
<p>In an article outlining Arrow’s “learning by doing” growth model, Arrow cited improved efficiency of airframe production and the Horndal iron works.</p>
<p>Arrow-Pratt securities are state-contingent claims which pay out a unit of commodity at a given date if state s is realized. Arrow-Pratt securities are used in analysis of security markets. They helped define measures of risk aversion.</p>
<p>Arrow analyzed land development under uncertainty with Claude Henry and Anthony Fisher.</p>
<p>Robert Lind’s work with Arrow proved that under certain conditions, risky public projects should be evaluated solely on their expected net benefit since the social cost of the risk tends to zero.</p>
<p>Along with Chenery, Arrow introduced a special case production function that applies when the substitution effect is continually elastic.</p>
<p>Social Choice and Individual Values</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrow Impossibility Theorem
<ul>
<li>the criteria of universal admissibility, unanimity, non-dictatorship, and irrelevance of independent alternatives cannot be satisfied by a rank-order voting system</li>
<li>an intransitive social preference could not be derived from a set of transitive preferences</li>
<li>implies that a preference ranking cannot be perfectly converted into a ranked voting system</li>
<li>showed the difficulty of a democratic social welfare function</li>
<li>extended by the Duggan-Schwartz theorem to a set of results</li>
<li>generalized by the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The Limits of Organization</p>
<ul>
<li>with Gerard Debreu</li>
<li>proved the existence of a competitive equilibrium, the Arrow-Debreu economy, which is crucial for General Equilibrium Theory (GET)</li>
<li>applied a fixed point theorem to prove that, if all agents have strictly convex preferences and endowments are strictly positive, there exists a competitive equilibrium</li>
<li>also with Lionel McKenzie?</li>
</ul>
<p>“Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care”</p>
<ul>
<li>argued lack of information and moral hazard made health care especially prone to market failure</li>
<li>stated that the economic complexities of medical care can be explained as “adaptations” to ucertainty in disease prevalence and efficacy of treatment</li>
<li>concluded that “the laissez-faire solution for medicin is intolerable”</li>
</ul>
<p>Essays in the Theory of Risk-Bearing</p>
<ul>
<li>describes the fundamental paradox that exists in the determination of demand for information</li>

<h3 id="robert-barro">Robert Barro</h3>
<p>Revived Ricardian equivalence, the idea that a change in taxes does not affect consumer behavior</p>
<h3 id="peter-boettke">Peter Boettke</h3>
<p>In a recent book on Hayek, Boettke emphasizes the role of the division of knowledge as part of his attempt to justify a cosmopolitan liberalism for the 21st century.</p>
<h3 id="guido-calabresi">Guido Calabresi</h3>
<p>Wrote an article setting forth similar thoughts about liability rules in automobile accidents. It was published a few weeks after Coase’s “The Problem Illustrated Anew”</p>
<h3 id="ronald-coase">Ronald Coase</h3>
<p>A Nobel-Prize-winning Chicago-school economist. Coase and fellow professor James Buchanan were allegedly forced out of UVA because of their conservative politics.</p>
<p>“The Problem of Social Cost”</p>
<ul>
<li>first outlined the Coase Theorem
<ul>
<li>given no transaction costs, bargaining will efficiently deal with the problem of externalities</li>
<li>allows initial allocation of property rights to be ignored when arriving at mutually beneficial soultions</li>
<li>the efficiency of a company is independent of whether the party who created those externalities is liable for their costs</li>
<li>often exemplified by considering a train whose sparks damage crops in a farm</li>
<li>contradicted Pigou’s theory about the role of the government in the economy</li>
<li>posited that agents can internalize externalities through negotiation</li>
<li>in the absence of transaction costs, any distribution of property rights leads to optimal resourec allocation</li>
<li>named by George Stigler</li>
</ul></li>
<li>used an example from Sturges v. Bridgman</li>
<li>noted that a cattle rancher who damages a farmer’s land will privately work out the most economically efficient recompense in the absence of transaction costs</li>
</ul>
<p>“The Problem Illustrated Anew”</p>
<ul>
<li>redevelops the Coase Theorem</li>
<li>also used an example from Struges v. Bridgman in which a confectioner’s mortars and pestles caused vibrations that prevented a doctor from using a stethoscope to examine patients
<ul>
<li>to illustrate how tort damages should be viewed as a bilateral problem</li>
</ul></li>
<li>published a few weeks before a Guido Calabresi article setting forth similar thoughts about liability rules in automobile accidents</li>
</ul>
<p>“The Nature of the Firm”</p>
<ul>
<li>develops the Coase conjecture
<ul>
<li>monopoly cannot sell above marginal cost since consumers will usually wait for the lowest prices</li>
</ul></li>
<li>discussed the interplay between monopolies which lower prices of durable goods after selling at the monopoly price and consumers who know that the lower price is coming</li>
<li>in a monopoly of durable goods, the seller will still have to lower their price to sell their product</li>
<li>the formation of the firm occurred to reduce transaction costs</li>
</ul>
<p>“The Federal Communications Commission”</p>
<ul>
<li>used Frank Stanton’s testimony to argue that the Supreme Court should allow the FCC to auction TV and radio bandwidth</li>
<li>compared airwave bandwith to Rembrandts</li>
</ul>
<p>“The Lighthouse in Economics”</p>

<h3 id="friedrich-engels">Friedrich Engels</h3>
<p>Co-author of the Communist Manifesto. Supported Marx through the profits from his industrial factory.</p>
<p>Engels analogized the phase transitions of water to explicate his law of “transition from quantity to quality” as a social evolutionary mechanism.</p>
<p>Engels used notes of a colleague on Lewis Henry Morgan’s Ancient Society to describe a four-stage development of the family, ending with “monogamous family”.</p>
<p>Engels labeled hunting and gathering as the last phase of political innocence.</p>
<p>The Communist Manifesto (see Karl Marx)</p>
<p>The Condition of the Working Class in England</p>
<ul>
<li>inspired by the high morality rates from disease in Liverpool and Manchester</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="milton-friedman">Milton Friedman</h3>
<p>One of the most influential economists of the last century. Friedman was a conservative neoliberal monetarist economist and a student of the Chicago School of economics.</p>
<p>After Richard Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard, he repeated Friedman’s earlier remark that “we are all Keynesians now”.</p>
<p>Friedman hosted the public Free to Choose TV series to respond to another thinker’s The Age of Uncertainty series.</p>
<p>Friedman coined the term “helicopter drop” for a policy response suitable to times of crisis.</p>
<p>Friedman taught the “Chicago Boys”, Chilean students of the Chicago school who implemented Friedman’s ideas with Pinochet in Chile. Protests broke out in 1976 when Friedman’s Nobel Prize was awarded due to the “Chicago Boys”’ work. Friedman coined the term of the resulting “miracle”.</p>
<p>During a congressional hearing, Friedman stated that multi-price auctions cost the treasury money and favor the dealer community which lead him advocating for uniforce price auctions. This viewpoint was largely invalidated by empirical studies conducted in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Friedman advocated for laissez-faire government policy.</p>
<p>Friedman criticized the Phillips Curve with Edmund Phelps because it did account for the natural rate of unemployment. See Edmund Phelps for more about Friedman and Phelps’ theory on the natural rate of unemployment.</p>
<p>Friedman’s “doctrine” is the argument that as long as companies remain within the rules, they should only work to maximise profits of shareholders.</p>
<p>In a paper with Leonard J. Savage, Friedman used Morgenstern and Von Neumann’s analysis of consumer units participating in both gambling and insurance to deevelop restrictions on an expected-value utility function, an early explanation of the increased risk-taking and increased wealth in the Friedman-Savage utility function. The curve of an individual’s utility function differs based on their wealth.</p>
<p>Friedman’s “twist” argument uses the analogy of asking an expert billiards player about their shots to argue that economic theories shouldn’t be tested by the “realism” of their assumptions.</p>
<p>In one paper, Friedman used the example of daylight savings time to argue for flexible exchange rates.</p>
<p>With Simon Kuznets, Friedman looked at the income levels of professionals like lawyers and dentists and concluded that the presence of licensing by the American Medical Association helped artifically boost the salaries of doctors.</p>
<p>Friedman criticized the Bretton Woods system, arguing that a floating exchange rate would be more effective.</p>
<p>Friedman’s non-parametric test involves ranking each item by subject and tallying the columns.</p>
<p>Friedman argued that economic freedom is a necessary step for political freedom.</p>

<p>He was a Canadian-American liberal economist. He was JFK’s ambassador to India.</p>
<p>Galbraith emphasized public service and limitations of the marketplace.</p>
<p>According to Galbraith, the belief that financial crises are normal occurrences is part of the “central tradition” of economics.</p>
<p>According to Galbraith, the protective purpose of the firm is survival, whereas the affirmative purpose of a firm is corporate growth.</p>

<h3 id="friedrich-von-hayek">Friedrich von Hayek</h3>
<p>Austrian-born Austrian-School economist. He won the 1974 Nobel prize in Economics along with Gunnar Myrdal, primarily for his thesis tying central planning to social stagnation.</p>
<p>Hayek criticized “rationalist constructivism”, the belief that institutions must be “deliberately designed” for human purposes.</p>
<p>Hayek argued against positivism by arguing that a purely quantitative method is unsatisfactory for social science because we use limited numerical information to understand primarily group human action.</p>
<p>Hayek proposed that a “spontaneous order” he termed “catallaxy” developed through the adjustment of many individual economies to the world market.</p>
<p>In a letter to The Times, Hayek criticized the 1977 Lib-Lib Pact by stating “a party that keeps a socialist government in power has lost all title to the name ‘Liberal’”.</p>

<h3 id="thomas-malthus">Thomas Malthus</h3>
<p>An English economist noted for his pessimism. He was a major influence on successors like John Maynard Keynes.</p>
<p>The Corn Laws were famous British protectionist laws designed to favor domestic grain producers by keeping tariffs high on grain imports. Malthus initially opposed the Corn Laws, but he later came to support them. Malthus justified his support for the Corn Laws by maintaining that they would help England attain a self-sufficient food supply. Ricardo argued the opposite, advocating for an end to the Corn Laws and support for free trade.</p>
<p>The Poor Laws were England’s system of relief for the poor. Malthus was critical of the Poor Laws, believing that they encouraged unsustainable population growth. Malthus argued for the centralization of the poor population of England in workhouses. Malthus stated that “the fare should be hard” in these workhouses, seeing them only as a place to provide the barest relief from suffering.</p>
<p>An Essay on the Principle of Population</p>

<p>The German Ideology</p>
<p>Theses on Feuerbach</p>
<h3 id="vilfredo-pareto">Vilfredo Pareto</h3>
<p>He introduced the concept of “indifference curves”.</p>
<p>He invented the 80/20 principle, also known as the “law of the vital few”, which most generally states that most effects stem from a few causes, but originally held that “80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population”.</p>
<p>He is the namesake of the Pareto chart, which is a chart that contains both bars and a line graph.</p>
<p>He created the concept of Pareto efficiency or Pareto optimality, which is a condition in which no individual can be better off without making another worse off. By the first theorem of welfare economics, Pareto efficiency holds for any competitive equilibrium. The Kaldor-Hicks criterion generalizes Pareto efficiency to allow for compensation of lost utility.</p>
<p>Manual of Political Economy</p>
<p>Circulation of the Elites</p>
<h3 id="edmund-phelps">Edmund Phelps</h3>
<p>With Milton Friedman, he developed the theory of a natural rate of unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment is an equilibrium in the unemployment level. Friedman and Phelps argued that attempts to decrease unemployment beyond the natural rate would cause inflation. The theory challenged the orthodoxy of the Philips Curve: the theoretical negative relationship between inflation and unemployment. Phelps quantified the natural rate of unemployment with his NAIRU model (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment).</p>
<p>He was the originator of the Hysteresis hypothesis.</p>

<h3 id="david-ricardo">David Ricardo</h3>
<p>He was an English economist known for introducing many important economic concepts, including the theory of comparative advantage and the Iron Law of Wages.</p>
<p>The Iron Law of Wages states that over time, wages would tend towards the minimum wage necessary to live.</p>
<p>Ricardian Equivalence, a term coined by Robert Barro, is Ricaardo’s theory that demand stays constant regardless of whether the government finances spending through debt or taxes.</p>
<p>He was an outspoken critic of the Corn Laws, a series of protective tariffs on agricultural imports. He claimed that the Corn Laws would drive wealth to landlords rather than industrialists, thus slowing Britain’s transition to an industrial power.</p>
