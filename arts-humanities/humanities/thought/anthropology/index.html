<p>Bateson wrote that the Baining were “unstudiable” and failed to “exhibit much activity beyond the mundane routines of daily work”.</p>
<p>One of Bateson’s books includes “metalogues” with titles like “Why do Frenchman?” and “Why a Swan?”.</p>
<p>Bateson formulated the double-bind theory of schizophrenia with Don Jackson, Jay Haley, and John Weakland. A “double bind” is a situation that arises from the “paradoxes of abstraction in communication”.</p>
<p>Bateson detailed the relationship between wau and laua in a certain New Guinea tribe, an analysis which would later incorporate ideas borrowed from cybernetics.</p>

<h3 id="jesse-bernard">Jesse Bernard</h3>
<p>Criticized Margaret Mead’s generalizations about the feminine nature of the Arapesh.</p>
<h3 id="franz-boas">Franz Boas</h3>
<p>1858-1942. The father of modern and/or American anthropology. He was the first professor of anthropology at Columbia and taught a lot of famous people in the field: Ruth Benedict, Margaret Mead, Alfred Koeber, Zora Neal Hurston, etc. He conducted fieldwork on the Inuits of Baffin Island and the Kwaikiutl (now referred to as Kwakwaka’wakw) on Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>Franz Boas created the four-field approach, dividing anthropology into archaeology, linguistics, physical anthropology, and cultural anthropology (“stones”, “tones”, “bones”, and “thrones”), because Boas believed cultures are too complex to be studied from a singular perspective.</p>
<p>Franz Boas’s display of the Northwest Coast Indian Hall at the American Museum of Natural History reflects his philosophy of organizing artifacts by cultural area.</p>
<p>At the Chicago World’s Fair, Boas made a model village for fourteen Kwakiutl from British Columbia.</p>
<p>Boas claimed that “if the willingness of man to suffer should disappear”, then man would too.</p>
<p>Boas organized the Jessup North Pacific Expedition, sponsored by industrialist Morris Jesup, that investigated the peoples of the North Pacific for the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>Boas traveled to Baffin Island to investigate the impact of the physical environment on native Inuit migrations. Boas erroneously claimed that the Inuit have an unusually high number of words for types of snow.</p>
<p>In the last chapter (“The Race Problem in Modern Society”) of one Boas work, Boas decries “attempts to impress one pattern of thought upon whole nations”.</p>
<p>In a book that questions the conception of the white race as culturally and physically superior, Boas dismissed concerns about racial purity as “imaginary” in a discussion of miscegenation.</p>
<p>In Boas’ fieldwork on the Kwaikiutl people of Vancouver Island, he broke with Lewis Henry Morgan’s theory of kinship. He concluded that human activity and thought must be understood in terms of the culture that originated them.</p>
<p>The Central Eskimo</p>

<p>Franz Boas and the Humboldtian Tradition</p>
<h3 id="joseph-campbell">Joseph Campbell</h3>
<p>Campbell popularized Adolf Bastian’s theory of ethinc variations called “folk ideas” and universial “elementary ideas”.</p>
<p>In one work, Campbell used the image of a four-year old claiming that a burnt match is a witch to illustrate the play-acting nature of “primitive religion”</p>
<p>Campbell filmed a PBS documentary with journalist Bill Moyers at George Lucas’ Skywalker Ranch.</p>
<p>A four-part work by Campbell concludes with a volume titled after the “creative” form of the central concept,which progresses through stages like “the way of the seeded earth” and the “way of the celestial lights”.</p>
<p>In the last of a series of six interviews, Campbell distinguished between Maslow’s peak experiences and Joyce’s aesthetic epiphanies as part of a larger discussion about God and the idea of eternity.</p>

<h3 id="auguste-comte">Auguste Comte</h3>
<p>Comte was the French founder founder of positivism and the first to use the term “sociology.” He was a student/secretary of utopian socialist Henri Saint-Simon.</p>
<p>Comte’s “second career”, brought on by the death of Clotilde de Vaux, included his attempt to establish seven atheistic sacraments for the future.</p>
<p>Comte proposed dividing the year into 13 months of 28 days, with an extra day to commemorate the dead. He suggested that the months be named after Moses and Homer.</p>
<p>Comte put forth the idea of a six-membered hierarchical complexity of sciences, beginning with the simplest, astronomy, and ending with social science, during which he coined the term “altruism”.</p>
<p>The distinction between social structure and social change originated from the distinction Compte drew between social statics and social dynamics.</p>
<p>Comte’s quest for discovering “invariant laws of the natural and social laws” was pursued through observation, experimentation, and comparison.</p>
<p>Comte’s normative theory envisioned a future in which people would “live for others”.</p>
<p>Comte argued that language, religion, and division of labor held human communities together.</p>
<p>The Course in Positive Philosophy</p>
<ul>
<li>“law of three stages”
<ul>
<li>human society moves from a theological to a metaphysical stage to the positive stage</li>
<li>theological stage = animism to polytheism to monothesim</li>
<li>metaphysical stage = pseudo-scientific</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="alan-dundes">Alan Dundes</h3>
<p>Sacred Narrative</p>
<ul>
<li>argued that Joseph Campbell, “like most universalists [is] content to merely assert universality rather than bother to document it”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="emile-durkheim">Emile Durkheim</h3>
<p>He was a French sociologist in the Positivist tradition, a student of Auguste Comte. He founded the journal L’annee sociologique He wanted to make sociology its own superior field of independent study because he believed that societies cannot be reduced to component parts. He created the concept of “collective effervescence” which is communities coming together and sharing thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>He debated Jacques Doleris on sex education, drawing on his theory that incest taboos came from primitive beliefs about the power of menstrual blood.</p>
<p>A central concept of Emile Durkheim’s was <em>anomie</em>, which is a condition of social disintegration. <em>Anomie</em> is a state in which rules have lost authority and occurs when a society is in a state of drastic change; older societal norms fade and are not immediately replaced by new ones. In this state of normlessness, members of society are left confused and feeling outcast.</p>
<p>The Division of Labor in Society</p>
<ul>
<li>his doctoral dissertation, first major work</li>
<li>explores the transition from primitive societies to industrial ones
<ul>
<li>the “dynamic density” of a group is the level of socialization within it</li>
<li>greater dynamic density is produced by an increase in population per area and degree of social interaction</li>
<li>greater dynamic density precipitates a move from organic solidarity to mechanical solidarity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“primitive” homogenous societies exhibit “mechanical solidarity”
<ul>
<li>a cohesion between individuals based on their similarities, whether that be through kinship, familial ties, or religion</li>
<li>people socialize through, and social order is preseved by, homogeneity of lifestyle and work</li>
</ul></li>
<li>modern industrial societies exhibit “organic solidarity”
<ul>
<li>individuals are tied together by the interdependence caused by the division of labor</li>
<li>people socialize through and social order is preserved by workspaces</li>
<li>allows individualism to persist in complex societies</li>
</ul></li>
<li>distinguished between repressive law and restitutive law
<ul>
<li>in repressive law, crimes are punished by the communnity</li>
<li>in restitutive law, crimes are punished by the courts</li>
<li>used the Twelve Tables, the Hebrew Torah, and the laws of Christian Europe to argue that civilization’s laws have moved from being repressive to restitutive</li>
</ul></li>
<li>urbanization weakened the power of guilds and increased the geographic span of political and economic institutions</li>
<li>the “collective conscience” is the mass of knowledge and beliefs of average members of a society</li>
<li>crime
<ul>
<li>crime was a normal part of “primitive” society in which people share a collective conscience</li>
<li>crime offends the states of the collective conscience</li>
<li>the punishment of crime attempts to maintain mechanical solidarity</li>
<li>crime “is only an anticipation of future morality - a step torward what will be”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Rules of the Sociological Method</p>
<ul>
<li>stressed the importance of having a specific object of study</li>
<li>the object of study for sociology is “social facts”</li>
<li>social facts
<ul>
<li>either normal (observed in majority of individuals) or pathological (observed in minority of individuals)</li>
<li>states of the collective mind”</li>
<li>consist of “manners of acting, thinking, and feeling eternal to the individual”</li>
<li>certain actions, objects, and beliefs (external characteristics) that gain “facticity” and become coercive forces on individuals</li>
<li>imposed on an individual from an outside source rather than the individual’s own conscience</li>
</ul></li>
<li>emphasized that sociologists should “treat social facts as things”</li>
<li>sociology must be brought into line as much as possible with the natural sciences by avoiding bias</li>
<li>advocated a rigorously scientific approach</li>
</ul>
<p>Suicide</p>
<ul>
<li>he studies suicide as a social fact</li>
<li>helped standardize the sociological method</li>
<li>observes that suicide is more prevalent among Protestants than Catholics and higher in peacetime than in wartime</li>
<li>he divides the rationales for suicide into four categories
<ul>
<li>egoistic = individual does not feel fully integrated into society, “excessive individuation”</li>
<li>altruistic = individual’s needs are subordinated to the needs of society, normlessness</li>
<li>anomie = individual has a lack of certainty and a sense of moral confusion about one’s place in society</li>
<li>fatalistic = society is so excessively regulated that an individual would rather die than live in it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>other thinkers noticed a lack of the “question of art” in Suicide, which inspired Bataille and Derrida to note the “problem of the exxcess”</li>
<li>concluded that Tarde’s law of imitation did not sufficiently explain suicide</li>
<li>deviance is a natural part of any society</li>
</ul>
<p>The Elementary Forms of Religious Life</p>
<ul>
<li>explores religion sui generis, as a social phenomenon</li>

<li>uses the rituals and totemism of the Aborigine people of Australia as an example</li>
<li>argues that religion developed from totemism when the items became sacred which then led to a conception of God</li>
<li>in totemism, groups of people project the image of society on an object</li>
<li>concluded that society annd the god that it worships are functionally equivalent</li>
<li>defined God as “society writ large”</li>
<li>distinguished between “beliefs”, states of opinions, and “rites”, determined modes of action</li>
<li>theorizes that religion was a so-called “primordial matri” for culture, with collective representations</li>
<li>beliefs should be evaluated according to the four criteria of volume, intensity, rigidity, and content</li>
<li>examined the “collective effervescence” inherennt to communal behaviors that separated the sacred from everyday life</li>
<li>identified the security of collective belief</li>
</ul>
<p>On the Normality of Crime</p>
<ul>
<li>says Socrates’ independence of thought rendered a service to humanity</li>

<h3 id="clifford-james-geertz">Clifford James Geertz</h3>
<p>1926-2006. A Princeton anthropologist, the pioneer of thick description and champion of symbolic anthropology. He was the teacher of Sherry Ortner.</p>
<p>Geertz argued that ethnolography must consist of both facts and commentary and analysis of aspects of culture.</p>
<p>In one work, Geertz notes that we have accepted seeing “native” people naked because their breasts have become as unhuman as a cow’s udders.</p>
<p>In an essay about “thick description”, Geertz borrows a term from Gilbert Ryle to say that thick description can distinguish the difference between a twitch and a wink.</p>

</ul>
<p>“Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight”</p>
<ul>
<li>analyzed “webs of significance” using the technique of “thick description”</li>
<li>cockfighting is an illegal blood sport with a complex betting system and an umpire</li>
<li>the men of the village identify with their participants in the cockfight, so cockfighting becomes a symbolic display of a certain kind of masculinity</li>

<p>Heyerdahl’s discovery of pollen samples near crater lakes lent credence to the three-epoch model of the history of Easter Island, which he suggested was the original island to bear the name “rapa”.</p>
<p>Heyerdahl sailed across the Pacific Ocean from Peru to the Tuamotu Islands on a balsa-wood raft, the Kontiki (named after the Incan sun god Kon-Tiki Viracocha).

<h3 id="claude-levi-strauss">Claude Levi-Strauss</h3>
<p>1908-2009. A French anthropologist, the pioneer of structural anthropology. He was the chair of social anthropology at the College de France 1959-1982. He was married to the anthropologist Dina Dreyfus, whose eye infection ended her time studying the Nambikwara with him. He is most famous for examining various myth systems and claiming certain mythemes are universal among humans.</p>
<p>Levi-Strauss popularized the term for a concrete unit of a myth, a mytheme, as part of his theory that myths share common, universal traits.</p>
<p>Levi-Strauss’s theory of mythology is summarized in the statement that “myth is language”.</p>
<p>In an introduction to Marcel Mauss, Levi-Strauss attacked Mauss’s use of “mana” as “void of meaning and thus apt to receive any meaning” in a passage coining “floating signifier”.</p>
<p>Levi-Strauss described a “house society” as a society in which kinship depended on “a corporate body holding an estate made up of both material and immaterial wealth”.</p>
<p>Levi-Strauss began a work by discussing the story of “The Macaws and Their Nest”, a study of the transformation of South American folk tales.</p>
<p>Levi-Strauss created a binary distinction that differentiates objects based on the degree of socialization they have experienced from their natural state.</p>

<h3 id="bronislaw-malinowski">Bronislaw Malinowski</h3>
<p>1884-1942. A Polish functionalist anthropologist who studied at the London School of Economics. He published several works while in exile in Papau New Guinea. He advised John Kenyatta and taught Edmund Leach. Contra Radcliffe-Brown, Malinowski’s work focused on culture and society meeting the needs of indivudals; societies did not just provide “individual” needs like food, but also had to provide for “instrumental” and “integrative” needs. He founded biocultural functionalism.</p>
<p>In one work, Malinowski claims that social rituals hold a straightforward biological purpose. That conception of functionalism was refuted by Radcliffe Brown.</p>
<p>Malinowski argued that charters, personnel, and norms were three of the six reuirements for the establishment of any institution.</p>
<p>Malinowski, in one passage, claimed his final goal was to “grasp the native’s point of view, his relation to life, to realize his vision of the world”, to find out “the hold life has on him”.</p>
