<h3 id="alfred-adler">Alfred Adler</h3>
<p>He split with Freud over the degree to which neuroses had a sexual basis. He was profoundly impacted by Jan Smuts’ holism.</p>
<p>The Neurotic Constitution</p>
<ul>
<li>neuroses result from people’s inability to achieve self-realization</li>
<li>in failing to achieve this sense of completeness, they develop “inferiority complexes” which inhibited their relations with successful people and dominated their relations with fellow unsuccessful people</li>
<li>“Individual Psychology”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bruce-alexander">Bruce Alexander</h3>
<p>In one experiment, rats chose to drink untainted water despite being addicted to morphine.</p>
<h3 id="solomon-asch">Solomon Asch</h3>
<p>He was a psychologist at Swarthmore college</p>
<p>First Asch conformity experiment</p>
<ul>
<li>tested whether individuals would conform to the thinking of a group of peers when the group was clearly wrong</li>
<li>participants were paired with seven other people who were in on the plan</li>
<li>group was shown a “base” line and then shown three other lines</li>
<li>asked which of the three other lines was the same length</li>
<li>seven confederates each picked the same wrong line</li>
<li>40% of the time, the subject also gave a wrong answer to conform with the group</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="albert-bandura">Albert Bandura</h3>
<p>Proposed a “triad” of reciprocal causation between “personal factors”, environment, and behavior.</p>
<p>Known for his social learning theory, which says that behaviors may be learned by observing models.</p>
<p>Bobo doll experiment</p>
<ul>
<li>conducted at Stanford, early 1960s</li>
<li>studied the effect of watching an adult model on the behavior of children</li>
<li>children observed an adult interacting with a “Bobo doll”—a large self-righting toy designed to look like a clown, bowling pin-shaped</li>
<li>in some cases, adult ignored doll; in others, the adult was highly aggressive towards it (hitting it with a mallet, throwing it, and yelling at it)</li>
<li>the children who watched the adult who was aggressive towards it were far more likely to also be aggressive towards it</li>
<li>supported social learning theory</li>
</ul>
<p>Moral Disengagement</p>
<ul>
<li>emphasized the agency of people who act inhumanely, claiming that they actively repress their ethical standards</li>

<ul>
<li>presented children across the country from all races with dolls that were identical except for skin color and hairstyle</li>
<li>asked children to identify “nice doll” and “bad doll” and other subjective judgements</li>

<h3 id="christian-von-ehrenfels">Christian von Ehrenfels</h3>
<p>Wrote of the “qualities” of gestalt psychology</p>
<h3 id="erik-erikson">Erik Erikson</h3>
<p>He theorized about how social institutions reflect the universal features of psychosocial development. He developed the idea of “psychohistory”, explaining how famous people were able to think and act the way they did.</p>
<p>He interviewed Sioux children at Pine Ridge and assisted Alfred Kroeber in examining the Yurok.</p>
<p>Childhood and Society</p>
<ul>
<li>posited eight stages of psychosocial development</li>
<li>each stage has a fundamental conflict of existence</li>
<li>the tension at each stage is an “identity crisis”
<ol type="1">
<li>trust vs mistrust (infancy, birth-18 months)</li>
<li>autonomy vs shame and doubt (toddler years, 18 months-3 years)</li>

<h3 id="sigmund-freud">Sigmund Freud</h3>
<p>The Austrian founder of psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>He used the free-association technique to identify neuroses caused by repressed memories.</p>
<p>He believed, contra materialists, that many problems were caused by mental states rather than by biochemical dysfunction.</p>
<p>He divided the psyche into <em>id</em> (illogical passion), <em>ego</em> (rational thought), and <em>superego</em> (moral and social conscience).</p>
<p>He created the concept of the Oedipus complex, that all males go through a stage where they fixate on their mothers and resent their fathers.</p>

<p>Contributed to the creation of a theory of gestalt psychology</p>
<h3 id="carl-jung">Carl Jung</h3>
<p>The Swiss founder of analytic psychology.</p>
<p>He split with Freud over the degree to which neuroses had a sexual basis, like Alfred Adler.</p>
<p>He studied word association at the Burgholzli Clinic.</p>
<p>He examined the schizophrenic fantasies of Frank Miller.</p>
<p>The <em>collective unconscious</em> is the “reservoir of the experiences of our species”, the cumulative experience of past generations. In one of his dreams, the collective unconscious was represented as a cave located below a basement and containing two human skulls. The collective unconscious is the basis for archetypes like the Shadow, the Great Mother, the Animus (male archetype) and the Anima (female archetype).</p>
<p><em>Individuation</em> is the person’s relationship with history and mythology. NHe claimed individuation can give meaning to the elderly.</p>
<p><em>Synchronicity</em> is two supposedly unrelated events that are still linked in some ways (an “acausal connecting principle”). For example, the similarities that exist in the mythology and folklore of various cultures throughout history. He argued that synchronicity can be explained through his theory of archetypes and the collective unconscious.</p>
<p><em>Syzygy</em> is the way opposites interact, including male/female, sun/moon, and life/death.</p>
<p>He summarized his theories in the introduction to the Evans-Wentz translation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead.</p>

<h3 id="lawrence-kohlberg">Lawrence Kohlberg</h3>
<p>Formulated a theory of moral development. It was derived from the “druggist’s dilemma” experiment and originally based on the cognitive development work of Jean Piaget. Carol Gilligan later modified it, arguing it was largely male-centered.</p>

<h3 id="kurt-koffka">Kurt Koffka</h3>
<p>Introduced gestalt psychology to the United States in the 1920s</p>
<h3 id="abraham-maslow">Abraham Maslow</h3>
<p>American psychologist known almost entirely for his idea of the “hierarchy of needs”. In the hierarchy of needs, human needs are placed on a pyramidal scale. Basic needs like food and safety are on the bottom and “self-actualization” is on the top. Self-actualized people are those who understand their individual needs and abilities and who have families, friends, and colleagues that support them and allow them to accomplish things on which they place value. The lowest unmet need on the hierarchy tends to dominate conscious thought. He developed this theory by examining Einstein and Jane Addams. The hierarchy is an elaboration upon a concept first proposed in The Organism by Kurt Goldstein.</p>
<p>He described transpersonal psychology as the “fourth force” of psychology.</p>
<p>He listed ten characteristics of a healthy individual, including the “ability to love and be loved” and “more openness to experience”.</p>
<p>He called moments of intense happiness “peak experiences”.</p>
<p>Motivation and Human Personality</p>

<h3 id="jean-piaget">Jean Piaget</h3>
<p>The Swiss founder of developmental psychology.</p>
<p>He performed rigorous studies of the way in which children learn and come to understand and respond to the world around them.</p>
<p>He divided children’s cognitive development into four stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal.</p>
<p>He was a proponent of genetic epistemology and founded the International Centre of Genetic Epistemology.</p>
<p>He argued for reflective abstraction rather than pre-existing linguistic structures in a debate with Noam Chomsky.</p>
<p>He performed experiments demonstrating that some people lack the understanding of conversation of number, one of which involved pouring water from a tall thin cup to a short fat cup.</p>
<p>He called new skills and knowledge “schema”.</p>
<p>He originated the term “object permanence”, and studied it’s learning.</p>
