<h3 id="alfred-adler">Alfred Adler</h3>
<p>An Austrian psychologist, he split with Freud over the degree to which neuroses had a sexual basis and founded the school of individual psychology, which built on Nietzsche’s notion of “will-to-power”. Individual psychology was based on understanding tenets of character development outlined in Understanding Human Nature.</p>
<p>“Guiding friction” and “guiding principle” create the idealized masculine ego. “Masculine protest” is the desire to be a real man. These ideas were influenced by correspondence with Hans Vaihinger and his philosophy of “As If”, known as fictionalism or fictional goals.</p>
<p>Adler put forth pampering, neglect, and “organ dysfunction” (physical afflictions can reflect someone’s attitudes and opinions) as the three factors that give rise to personality problems.</p>
<p>Adler argued that lazy children are fulfilling their desires when they are scolded in a work that proceeds to discuss ohow similar they are to children that feign sickness.</p>
<p>The Neurotic Constitution/Character</p>
<ul>
<li>neuroses result from people’s inability to achieve self-realization</li>
<li>in failing to achieve this sense of completeness, they develop “inferiority complexes” which inhibited their relations with successful people and dominated their relations with fellow unsuccessful people</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding Human Nature</p>
<ul>
<li>Vienna lectures elaborating individual psychology’s tenets</li>
<li>firstborn children were “dethroned” upon the arrival of a new child”</li>
<li>proposed that middle children usually have the most rebellious personalities, and the one most likely to be revolutionary with the least amount of personality defects</li>
<li>birth order supposedly influenced personality</li>
<li>elaborated his idea of understanding character development</li>
</ul>
<p>Social Interest</p>
<ul>
<li>described four methods of creating “distance” from personal problems
<ul>
<li>“moving backwards”</li>
<li>“standing still”</li>
<li>“hesitation”</li>
<li>“constructing obstacles”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“social interest” is the feeling of living and cooperating in a community</li>
<li>a lack of social interest can be seen in the “ruling”, “getting”, and “avoiding” types of lifestyles</li>
<li>built on Jan Smut’s idea of holism</li>
</ul>
<p>In one book, Adler discussed how social inequality leads both boys and girls to express exaggerated masculine behavior and claimed that children spend their first 4-5 years developing their “style of life”</p>
<h3 id="bruce-alexander">Bruce Alexander</h3>
<p>In one experiment, rats chose to drink untainted water despite being addicted to morphine.</p>
<h3 id="solomon-asch">Solomon Asch</h3>
<p>He was a Polish-born Princeton psychologist. He was an immigrant to the United States and learned English as a teenager from reading Charles Dickens. Asch mentored Stanley Milgram at Princeton and inspired him to perform the obedience experiment.</p>
<p>Asch advocated the notion that subjects reinterpret the intended meaning of words based on information about the speaker to criticize Irving Lorge’s experiment on prestige suggestion. Asch showed that people perceive quotations about rebellion differently if the source was listed as either Thomas Jefferson or Vladimir Lenin, an example of prestige suggestion.</p>
<p>Asch wrote one work about how children achieve acculturation and it may have been influenced by his own experiment.</p>
<p>In one experiment, Asch gave groups of subjects two lists of adjectives for a person with the only difference being the word “warm” or “cold” to test “impression formation”. The traits of people who had “warm” on the list were interpreted positively, while the traits of people of who had “cold” on the list were interpreted negatively, even if those traits were exactly the same.</p>
<p>In one experiment with Ebenholz, Asch found that the order of things listed in free recall doesn’t correlate with the order they were learned. They posited the principle of associative symmetry to explain the direction of associatve recall.</p>
<p>First Asch conformity experiment</p>
<ul>
<li>1951</li>
<li>intended to test the conclusions of Muzafar Sharif’s use of the autokinetic effect</li>
<li>published in Groups, Leadership, and Men</li>
<li>tested whether individuals would conform to the thinking of a group of peers when the group was clearly wrong</li>
<li>Swarthmore college students were paired with seven other people who were actually confederates for a supposed vision test</li>
<li>group was shown a “base” line and then shown two other lines</li>
<li>asked which of the three other lines was the same length</li>
<li>seven confederates each picked the same wrong line</li>
<li>40% of the time, the subject also gave a wrong answer to conform with the group</li>
<li>after the experiment, “I called them as I saw them, sir” and “if I’d been the first I probably would have responded differently”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="albert-bandura">Albert Bandura</h3>
<p>A Stanford psychologist, the most frequently cited living psychologist according to a 2014 Diener et al study. As a graduate student, Bandura pinned a dead rat to the department bulletin board with a note reading “ran according to Tolman’s theory”, thus implying it had been murdered by his advisor, Kenneth Spence.</p>
<p>Bandura formulated social learning theory, which says that behaviors may be learned by observing models, not strictly behavioral. The four methods of learning are attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation.</p>
<p>Bandura developed a guided mastery therapy, behavioral modeling therapy for phobias that helped snake-phobes by first watch an actor pretend to fear a snake, but succeed in taking it out of a cage. The snake-phobes then were able to drape snakes around their necks. They were helped in getting over their fear of they had greater self-efficacy.</p>
<p>Bandura described a “judgmental sub-function” in the mind as part of his negative feedback model of self-regulation.</p>
<p>Bandura coined the term “agentic” to describe people who are proactive about self-learning.</p>
<p>In one experiment with Carol and Kupers Whalen, test subjects only took candy after getting above 40 points in a rigged bowling contraption.</p>
<p>In a paper discussing primary and secondary suggestibility, Asch and Arthur Benton replaced the heat illusion test of Eysenck and Furneaux with a vibration suggestion test.</p>
<p>Asch collaborated with Charles Benight in various articles, challenging th ediathesis-stress model’s application to depression and PTSD.</p>
<p>Bobo doll experiment</p>
<ul>
<li>conducted at Stanford, early 1960s, with Dorothea and Sheila Ross</li>
<li>studied the effect of watching an adult model on the behavior of Palo Alto children</li>
<li>children observed an adult interacting with a “Bobo doll”—a large self-righting toy designed to look like a clown, bowling pin-shaped</li>
<li>in some cases, adult ignored doll; in others, the adult was highly aggressive towards it
<ul>
<li>hitting it with a mallet, throwing it, and yelling at it (“pow!”, “sock him!”, “sockeroo!”)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the children who watched the adult who was aggressive towards it were far more likely to also be aggressive towards it</li>
<li>supported social learning theory</li>
<li>in a follow-up, there were live, filmed, or cartoon versions of the same behavior</li>

<h3 id="sigmund-freud">Sigmund Freud</h3>
<p>The Austrian founder of psychoanalysis. The father of Anna Freud. Most of his theories were expunged from the third ediciton of the DSM. The Sigmund Freud Museum does not have his couch. His letters to his fiancee Martha Bernays were recently published. His offical biographer was Ernest Jones, and his British disciples engaged in the “controversial discussions”.</p>
<p>Freud used the free-association technique to identify neuroses caused by repressed memories.</p>
<p>In a letter to Wilhelm Fliess, Freud theorized a sort of vivid but false memory called the “screen memory”.</p>
<p>Freud believed, contra materialists, that many problems were caused by mental states rather than by biochemical dysfunction.</p>
<p>Freud divided the psyche into <em>id</em> (illogical passion), <em>ego</em> (rational thought), and <em>superego</em> (moral and social conscience).</p>
<p>Freud created the concept of the Oedipus complex, that all males go through a stage where they fixate on their mothers and resent their fathers. He also created the concept of penis envy, which led to girls disparaging their mothers for appearing to be castrated.</p>
<p>Freud claimed totemism was the first form of father-surrogate. He stated that totemism prevented incest and linked it with taboo.</p>
<p>Freud unsuccessfully treated his friend Ernst Fleischl von Marxow with cocaine.</p>

<ul>
<li>criticized a hypothetical therapist who posits a forgetting preference for proper names and focused on the deviations from everyday stereotpyes</li>
<li>he recalls saying “Botticelli” and “Boltraffio” rather than “Signorelli”, a type of parapraxis (Freudian slip)
<ul>
<li>used a complex chain of steps involving a journey to Herzegovina to explain the forgetting of Luca Signorelli’s last name</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</p>
<ul>
<li>described a life drive competing with a death drive as Eros versus Thanatos</li>
<li>divided the mind into parts ruled by social mores, reality, and the pleasure principle</li>
<li>uses children’s games and self-injury as examples of the life-drive, the universal mental urge to “restore to an earlier state”</li>
<li>Freud’s grandson Ernst threw a cotton reel out of his crib and uttered the sounds “ooh”, and then his mother would bring it back to him and Ernst woudl say “aah”, which he interpreted as the words fort and da (Germn for “gone” and “there”)</li>
<li>after seeing the trauma of veterans from the first World War</li>

<h3 id="carl-jung">Carl Jung</h3>
<p>The Swiss founder of analytic psychology. He split with Freud over the degree to which neuroses had a sexual basis, like Alfred Adler.</p>
<p>He studied word association at the Burgholzli Clinic.</p>
<p>He examined the schizophrenic fantasies of Frank Miller.</p>
<p>The collective unconscious is the “reservoir of the experiences of our species”, the cumulative experience of past generations. In one of Jung’s dreams, the collective unconscious was represented as a cave located below a basement and containing two human skulls. The collective unconscious is the basis for archetypes like the Shadow, the Great Mother, the Animus (male archetype) and the Anima (female archetype).</p>
<p>Individuation is the person’s relationship with history and mythology. He claimed individuation can give meaning to the elderly.</p>
<p>Synchronicity is two supposedly unrelated events that are still linked in some ways (an “acausal connecting principle”). For example, the similarities that exist in the mythology and folklore of various cultures throughout history. He argued that synchronicity can be explained through his theory of archetypes and the collective unconscious. Jung was collaborated with a statistician to examine hundreds of horoscopes of married couples to look for an “acausal connecting principle” that would explain parapsychology.</p>
<p>Syzygy is the way opposites interact, including male/female, sun/moon, and life/death.</p>
<p>Jung summarized his theories in the introduction to the Evans-Wentz translation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead.</p>
<p>Jung divided people into introverts and extraverts, and provided the basis for the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator personality system.</p>
<p>Jung designated Eve, Helen, Mary, and Sophia as four stages of male development.</p>
<p>Jung had a vision of a “monstrous flood” devastating Europe shortly before the outbreak of World War One.</p>
<p>Jung names the first codex of the Nag-Hammadi library.</p>
<p>Jung argued that the promulgation of the dogma of the Assumption in 1854 expressed a deep yearning within a concept composed of two parts: instinct and archetypes.</p>

<h3 id="abraham-maslow">Abraham Maslow</h3>
<p>American psychologist known almost entirely for his idea of the “hierarchy of needs”. In the hierarchy of needs, human needs are placed on a pyramidal scale. Basic needs like food and safety are on the bottom and “self-actualization” is on the top. Self-actualized people are those who understand their individual needs and abilities and who have families, friends, and colleagues that support them and allow them to accomplish things on which they place value. The lowest unmet need on the hierarchy tends to dominate conscious thought. He developed this theory by examining Einstein and Jane Addams. The hierarchy is an elaboration upon a concept first proposed in The Organism by Kurt Goldstein.</p>
<p>He described transpersonal psychology as the “fourth force” of psychology.</p>
<p>He listed ten characteristics of a healthy individual, including the “ability to love and be loved” and “more openness to experience”.</p>
<p>He called moments of intense happiness “peak experiences”.</p>

<h3 id="jean-piaget">Jean Piaget</h3>
<p>The Swiss founder of developmental psychology.</p>
<p>He performed rigorous studies of the way in which children learn and come to understand and respond to the world around them.</p>
<p>He divided children’s cognitive development into four stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal.</p>
<p>He was a proponent of genetic epistemology and founded the International Centre of Genetic Epistemology.</p>
<p>He argued for reflective abstraction rather than pre-existing linguistic structures in a debate with Noam Chomsky.</p>
<p>He performed experiments demonstrating that some people lack the understanding of conversation of number, one of which involved pouring water from a tall thin cup to a short fat cup.</p>
<p>He called new skills and knowledge “schema”.</p>
<p>He originated the term “object permanence”, and studied it’s learning.</p>
