<h3 id="socrates">Socrates</h3>
<p>An ancient Greek philosopher, perhaps the most important (ancient Greek philosophers are divided into pre-Socratic and Socratic). He was the teacher of Plato and produced no written works himself. We only know about him from Plato’s Socratic dialogues. He would go around Athens engaging in question-and-answer sessions to search for truth and draw out contradictions (the “Socratic method”). Athens put him on trial for corrupting the city’s youth, and he was sentenced to death by drinking hemlock.</p>
