### Kenneth Arrow

Investigated the problems caused by asymmetric information in markets

Social Choice and Individual Values

- Arrow's Impossibility Theorem:
- the criteria of universal admissibility, unanimity, non-dictatorship, and irrelevance of independent alternatives cannot be satisfied by a rank-order voting system

### Robert Barro

Revived Ricardian equivalence, the idea that a change in taxes does not affect consumer behavior

### Ronald Coase

A Nobel-Prize-winning economist.

The Coase Theorem states that, given no transaction costs, bargaining will efficiently deal with the problem of externalities. It allows initial allocation of property rights to be ignored when arriving at mutually beneficial soultions.

The Coase conjecture states that a monopoly cannot sell above marginal cost since consumers will usually wait for the lowest prices.

He used the case of Struges v. Bridgmanto to illustrate how tort damages should be viewed as a bilateral problem.

"The Problem of Social Cost"

- first outlined the Coase Theorem

### Friedrich Engels

Co-author of the Communist Manifesto. Supported Marx through the profits from his industrial factory.

He labeled hunting and gathering as the last phase of political innocence.

### Milton Friedman

One of the most influential economists of the last century, he was a conservative economist and a student of the Chicago School of economics.

He advocated for laissez-faire government policy.

He criticized the Phillips Curve with Edmund Phelps because it did account for the natural rate of unemployment. See [Edmund Phelps](#edmund-phelps) for Friedman and Phelps' theory on the natural rate of unemployment.

The Friedman Rule is monetary policy that would set nominal interest rates to zero.

He argued that licensing doctors resulted in the inflation of their incomes.

One of his central theories is the permanent income hypothesis, which followed from his criticism of the Keynesian consumption function. According to the permanent income hypothesis, individuals spend money based on their estimate of their expected long-term average income. This is in contrast to Keynesian theory, which views consumption as dependent on after-tax income. There are policy ramifications or the permanent income hypothesis: if it is true, short-term increases in an individual's income will not substantially change their spending habits.

He worked with Leonard Savage to theorize that the curve of an individual's utility function differs based on their wealth.

The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money

- judged most of classical economic analysis to be a special case, gave a general theory
- advocated for deficit spending to increase aggregate demand during prolonged recessions like the Great Depression
  - inspired FDR and modern monetary policy
- argued against Say's Law (supply creates demand)
- it is demand that powers the economy

- because of price stickiness (workers may not always act in a way that an economist would judge as rational in making wage demands because prices and wages take time to adjust to market changes)
- Absolute income hypothesis
- introduced the MPC curve
- introduced liquidity preference: people prefer cash to securities

The Economic Consequences of Peace

### Thomas Malthus

An English economist noted for his pessimism. He was a major influence on successors like John Maynard Keynes.

The Corn Laws were famous British protectionist laws designed to favor domestic grain producers by keeping tariffs high on grain imports. Malthus initially opposed the Corn Laws, but he later came to support them. Malthus justified his support for the Corn Laws by maintaining that they would help England attain a self-sufficient food supply. Ricardo argued the opposite, advocating for an end to the Corn Laws and support for free trade.

The Poor Laws were England's system of relief for the poor. Malthus was critical of the Poor Laws, believing that they encouraged unsustainable population growth. Malthus argued for the centralization of the poor population of England in workhouses. Malthus stated that "the fare should be hard" in these workhouses, seeing them only as a place to provide the barest relief from suffering.

An Essay on the Principle of Population

- 1798
- Malthus' most famous work
- Population always increases in a geometric progression, in contrast with food production, which increases in an arithmetic progression
- population size was kept in check through a combination of natural checks (war, famine, disease) and preventative checks (abstinence)
- influenced many thinkers, including Charles Darwin

Principles of Political Economy

- should not be confused with Ricardo's book of the same name, which was written to rebut this book
- challenges Say's Law ("supply creates its own demand")
- oversupply (glut) could lead to economic depression
- contrasts with Say and Ricardo, who felt that the economy would fix itself by increasing demand

An Inquiry into the Nature and Progress of Rent

- developed the differential theory of rent, contemporaneously with several colleagues including Ricardo
- rent is a deduction from the surplus

The German Ideology

Theses on Feuerbach

### Lewis Henry Morgan

### Vilfredo Pareto

He introduced the concept of "indifference curves".

He invented the 80/20 principle, also known as the "law of the vital few", which most generally states that most effects stem from a few causes, but originally held that "80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population".

He is the namesake of the Pareto chart, which is a chart that contains both bars and a line graph.

He created the concept of Pareto efficiency or Pareto optimality, which is a condition in which no individual can be better off without making another worse off. By the first theorem of welfare economics, Pareto efficiency holds for any competitive equilibrium. The Kaldor-Hicks criterion generalizes Pareto efficiency to allow for compensation of lost utility.

Manual of Political Economy

Circulation of the Elites

### Edmund Phelps

With Milton Friedman, he developed the theory of a natural rate of unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment is an equilibrium in the unemployment level. Friedman and Phelps argued that attempts to decrease unemployment beyond the natural rate would cause inflation. The theory challenged the orthodoxy of the Philips Curve: the theoretical negative relationship between inflation and unemployment. Phelps quantified the natural rate of unemployment with his NAIRU model (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment).

He was the originator of the Hysteresis hypothesis.

### Francois Quesnay

He was the leader of the Physiocrats, which were the first systematic school of economic thought. He thought that laissez-faire policies are economically and morally righteous and that land is the ultimate source of all wealth.

### David Ricardo

He was an English economist known for introducing many important economic concepts, including the theory of comparative advantage and the Iron Law of Wages.

The Iron Law of Wages states that over time, wages would tend towards the minimum wage necessary to live.

Ricardian Equivalence, a term coined by Robert Barro, is Ricaardo's theory that demand stays constant regardless of whether the government finances spending through debt or taxes.

He was an outspoken critic of the Corn Laws, a series of protective tariffs on agricultural imports. He claimed that the Corn Laws would drive wealth to landlords rather than industrialists, thus slowing Britain's transition to an industrial power.

The High Price of Bullion

- calls for the use of specie (metal currency) because bank notes (paper currency) are inherently susceptible to depreciation

Principles of Political Economy and Taxation

- should not be confused with Malthus' book of the same name, which this book is a rebuttal of
- Theory of comparative advantage
  - every pair of potential trading partners can benefit by trade if they are producing at least two goods
  - this result is true for every pair, no matter how unproductive one of the parties might be
  - because of opportunity cost, each party should specialize in what it doest best and then trade for everything else
  - used example of Britain's cloth industry and Portugal's wine industry
- attempted to justify unfettered international trade through the above

### Adam Smith

A Scottish economist, founder of the Classical School of economics.

Lectures of Jurisprudence

[See Qwiz5's article for more information](https://www.qwizbowl.com/post/qwiz5-quizbowl-ricardo)

### Thorstein Veblen

He critiqued Irving Fisher's The Nature of Capital and Income. He is the namesake for Veblen goods, a class of commodities for which price and demand vary directly, such as luxury items. He established a dichotomy between that which is related to tribal legends of the past ("ceremonial") and that which is related to the technological imperative ("instrumental").
