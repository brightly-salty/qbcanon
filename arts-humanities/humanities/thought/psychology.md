### Alfred Adler

He split with Freud over the degree to which neuroses had a sexual basis. He was profoundly impacted by Jan Smuts' holism.

The Neurotic Constitution

- neuroses result from people's inability to achieve self-realization
- in failing to achieve this sense of completeness, they develop "inferiority complexes" which inhibited their relations with successful people and dominated their relations with fellow unsuccessful people
- "Individual Psychology"

### Bruce Alexander

In one experiment, rats chose to drink untainted water despite being addicted to morphine.

### Solomon Asch

He was a psychologist at Swarthmore college

First Asch conformity experiment

- tested whether individuals would conform to the thinking of a group of peers when the group was clearly wrong
- participants were paired with seven other people who were in on the plan
- group was shown a "base" line and then shown three other lines
- asked which of the three other lines was the same length
- seven confederates each picked the same wrong line
- 40% of the time, the subject also gave a wrong answer to conform with the group

### Albert Bandura

Proposed a "triad" of reciprocal causation between "personal factors", environment, and behavior.

Known for his social learning theory, which says that behaviors may be learned by observing models.

Bobo doll experiment

- conducted at Stanford, early 1960s
- studied the effect of watching an adult model on the behavior of children
- children observed an adult interacting with a "Bobo doll"---a large self-righting toy designed to look like a clown, bowling pin-shaped
- in some cases, adult ignored doll; in others, the adult was highly aggressive towards it (hitting it with a mallet, throwing it, and yelling at it)
- the children who watched the adult who was aggressive towards it were far more likely to also be aggressive towards it
- supported social learning theory

Moral Disengagement

- emphasized the agency of people who act inhumanely, claiming that they actively repress their ethical standards

Social Foundations of Thought and Action

- advocates changing your self-perception to improve your abilities via higher "self-efficacy"

### Mamie Phipps Clark and Kenneth Clark

They were a married team of psychologists, the first African Americans to receive doctorates of psychology at Columbia University.

Clark doll experiment

- presented children across the country from all races with dolls that were identical except for skin color and hairstyle
- asked children to identify "nice doll" and "bad doll" and other subjective judgements
- children of all races showed a preference for the white doll
- showed racism created an inherent sense of inferiority in black children even by the age of 5
- cited by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board as evidence to overturn "separate but equal"

### Christian von Ehrenfels

Wrote of the "qualities" of gestalt psychology

### Erik Erikson

He theorized about how social institutions reflect the universal features of psychosocial development. He developed the idea of "psychohistory", explaining how famous people were able to think and act the way they did.

He interviewed Sioux children at Pine Ridge and assisted Alfred Kroeber in examining the Yurok.

Childhood and Society

- posited eight stages of psychosocial development
- each stage has a fundamental conflict of existence
- the tension at each stage is an "identity crisis"
  1. trust vs mistrust (infancy, birth-18 months)
  2. autonomy vs shame and doubt (toddler years, 18 months-3 years)
  3. initiative vs guilt (preschool years, 3-5)
  4. industry vs inferiority (middle school years, 6-11)
  5. identity vs confusion (teen years, 12-18)
  6. intimacy vs isolation (young adult years, 18-40)
  7. generativity vs stagnation (middle age, 40-65)
  8. integrity vs despair (older adulthood, 65-death)

On the Origins of Militant Nonviolence

- analyzed Ghandi's concept of satyagraha

Vital Involvement in Old Age

- interviewed 29 octogenarians from California

A Way of Looking at Things

- a collection of essays

Young Man Luther

- psychohistory of Martin Luther
- examined "The Meaning of Meaning It"
- uses incidents such as the "revelation in the tower" and "the fit in the choir" to connect Luther's theological positions to the individual ego

Gandhi's Truth

- psychohistory of Gandhi

### Leon Festinger

A psychologist who introduced the concept of cognitive dissonance in his book *When Prophecy Fails*.

### Sigmund Freud

The Austrian founder of psychoanalysis.

He used the free-association technique to identify neuroses caused by repressed memories.

He believed, contra materialists, that many problems were caused by mental states rather than by biochemical dysfunction.

He divided the psyche into *id* (illogical passion), *ego* (rational thought), and *superego* (moral and social conscience).

He created the concept of the Oedipus complex, that all males go through a stage where they fixate on their mothers and resent their fathers.

He claimed totemism was the first form of father-surrogate. He stated that totemism prevented incest and linked it with taboo.

One odd clue that comes up often is that he used cocaine.

He claimed that technology makes people into unhappy Gods with prosthetic limbs.

The Interpretation of Dreams

The Psychopathology of Everyday Life

Beyond the Pleasure Principle

- described a life-drive competing with a death drive as Eros versus Thanatos

Civilization and its Discontents

- analyzed the "oceanic feeling"
- chronicled the conflict between individuality and society's demand for conformity
- claims that civilization can only exist by frustrating individual drives

### Isadore From

Contributed to the creation of a theory of gestalt psychology

### Carl Jung

The Swiss founder of analytic psychology.

He split with Freud over the degree to which neuroses had a sexual basis, like Alfred Adler.

He studied word association at the Burgholzli Clinic.

He examined the schizophrenic fantasies of Frank Miller.

The *collective unconscious* is the "reservoir of the experiences of our species", the cumulative experience of past generations. In one of his dreams, the collective unconscious was represented as a cave located below a basement and containing two human skulls. The collective unconscious is the basis for archetypes like the Shadow, the Great Mother, the Animus (male archetype) and the Anima (female archetype).

*Individuation* is the person's relationship with history and mythology. NHe claimed individuation can give meaning to the elderly.

*Synchronicity* is two supposedly unrelated events that are still linked in some ways (an "acausal connecting principle"). For example, the similarities that exist in the mythology and folklore of various cultures throughout history. He argued that synchronicity can be explained through his theory of archetypes and the collective unconscious.

*Syzygy* is the way opposites interact, including male/female, sun/moon, and life/death.

He summarized his theories in the introduction to the Evans-Wentz translation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead.

He divided people into introverts and extraverts, and provided the basis for the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator personality system.

He designated Eve, Helen, Mary, and Sophia as four stages of male development.

He had a vision of a "monstrous flood" devastating Europe shortly before the outbreak of World War One.

Answer to Job

- fourth evil side of God
- "God who knew no moderation in his emotion"

The Seven Sermons to the Dead

- interest in Gnosticism and mysticism apparent

### Lawrence Kohlberg

Formulated a theory of moral development. It was derived from the "druggist's dilemma" experiment and originally based on the cognitive development work of Jean Piaget. Carol Gilligan later modified it, arguing it was largely male-centered.

- Pre-conventional phase
  - Stage one (driven by obedience and punishment)
  - Stage two (driven by self-interest)
- Conventional phase
  - Stage three (good intentions as determined by social consensus)
  - Stage four (driven by authority and social order obedience)
- Post-conventional phase
  - Stage five (driven by social contract)
  - Stage six (driven by universal ethical principles)

### Kurt Koffka

Introduced gestalt psychology to the United States in the 1920s

### Abraham Maslow

American psychologist known almost entirely for his idea of the "hierarchy of needs". In the hierarchy of needs, human needs are placed on a pyramidal scale. Basic needs like food and safety are on the bottom and "self-actualization" is on the top. Self-actualized people are those who understand their individual needs and abilities and who have families, friends, and colleagues that support them and allow them to accomplish things on which they place value. The lowest unmet need on the hierarchy tends to dominate conscious thought. He developed this theory by examining Einstein and Jane Addams. The hierarchy is an elaboration upon a concept first proposed in The Organism by Kurt Goldstein.

He described transpersonal psychology as the "fourth force" of psychology.

He listed ten characteristics of a healthy individual, including the "ability to love and be loved" and "more openness to experience".

He called moments of intense happiness "peak experiences".

Motivation and Human Personality

- rejected determinism
- further described the hierarchy of needs
- hierarchy of needs expanded into the ERG theory by Clayton Alderfer

Toward a Psychology of Being

- expanded on the hierarchy of needs

Eupsychian Management

### Stanley Milgram

A Yale psychologist who performed a number of interesting experiments. He coined the term "familiar stranger", which refers to a person one sees regularly but does not interact with.

Shock/Obedience experiment

- After Nazi Adolf Eichmann's high-profile trial
  - Claimed that the Nazis carrying out the Holocaust did it because they were merely “following orders”
- At Yale University
- Tested obedience to authority
- Ordered “teachers” to test the memories of “learners” an punish them for wrong answers
- Punished with increasingly intense electric shocks to test the teachers' willingness to inflict pain under orders
- Learners screamed in pain and pleaded with them to stop, experimenter said “please continue”
- Over 60% of teachers administered shocks so powerful they would have killed the learner if real
- Used to describe the behavior that occurred at Abu Ghraib prison (like Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment)

Small World experiment

- Mailed a number of people in Nebraska and Kansas a package, and asked them to send it to a target in Boston
- If they knew the target directly, they could send it directly to the target. If not, they were to send it to an acquaintance most likely to directly know the target.
- Of the packages that did make it to Boston, they typically did so in five or six steps
- Led to the coining of the phrase “six degrees of separation”
- Important early study of social networks
- "Lost letter" experiment
- Left around letters addressed to hospitals and Nazis an waited to see which got delivered
- Obviously letters to Friends of the Nazi Party got mailed less often

Other experiments

- Subjects speak shadow words provided by a radio
- Studied the mental maps of residents of New York and Paris
- Breaching experiments
  - Subway riders asked to give up their seats

"Vertical City"

- examined the effect of skyscrapers on urban life

### George Miller

The "Magic Number" of 7 +/- 2 (5-9), the number of items which fit in short-term/working memory

### Ivan Pavlov

A physiologist who originally studied the digestive tracks of dogs (Novel Prize 1904) who happened to perform a psychological experiment. He originally studied transmarginal inhibition, the body's proclivity to shut down when faced with overwhelming pain and stress.

Pavlov's dogs

- First to study the ways in which unconditioned and neutral stimuli could be linked together through repetition to produce a conditioned response
- Noticed his dogs began to salivate as soon as they saw the lab assistant who normally fed them - “psychic secretion”
- Produced the sound of metronome (not bell) and then presented food to the dogs
- Dogs were trained to salivate whenever they heard the metronome/bell
- "Conditional reflex"

### Jean Piaget

The Swiss founder of developmental psychology.

He performed rigorous studies of the way in which children learn and come to understand and respond to the world around them.

He divided children's cognitive development into four stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal.

He was a proponent of genetic epistemology and founded the International Centre of Genetic Epistemology.

He argued for reflective abstraction rather than pre-existing linguistic structures in a debate with Noam Chomsky.

He performed experiments demonstrating that some people lack the understanding of conversation of number, one of which involved pouring water from a tall thin cup to a short fat cup.

He called new skills and knowledge "schema".

He originated the term "object permanence", and studied it's learning.

He worked closely with programming language designer Seymour Papert, whose namesake principle attempts to explain some of Piaget's results.

The Language and Thought of a Child

The Origins of Intelligence in Children.

### Howard Roffwarg

Performed a 1978 study that altered dreams by having subjects wear red-tinted goggles for nine days.

### Martin Seligman

Learned helplessness experiments

- divided dogs into three groups: no electric shocks, stoppable electric shocks, and unstoppable electric shocks ("no control")
- then placed the dogs in aa new situation where there was control (an easy means of escape)
- those given no control originally made no attempt at escape, they learned helplessness
- major implications for the understanding and treatment of clinical depression via therapy

### B. F. Skinner

20th century American physiologist who became a leading proponent of behaviorism. He created the school of radical behaviorism.

He claimed that all human actions could be understood in terms of physical stimuli and learned responses.

He taught pigeons to play table tennis using his ideas.

Walden II

- utopia
- T. E. Frazier and five others lead a community
- Planners, Managers, Workers, and Scientists

Skinner box

- explored the effects of operant conditioning
- similar to puzzle box developed by Edward Thorndike
- small chamber into which an animal is introduced, and a lever/button/etc, called "manipulandum"
- manipulandum can deliver food, turn off an electrified floor, or otherwise affect environment
- allows researchers to observe changes in behavior in response to repeated reinforcements or punishments

Verbal Behavior

- proposed the idea of "mand"
- behaviorist theory of language learning

Beyond Freedom and Dignity

- "people are bodies"
- argued against free will

### Edward Tolman

He originated the theory of cognitive maps after experiments with rats.

### John Watson

The American psychologist who was the founder of behaviorism. He was heavily influenced by the ideas of Jacques Loeb. He collaborated with Knight Dunlap and Adolf Meyer. He also created the "Twelve Infants Theory"

He was also a marketer, which is kind of weird but comes up in power clues. He created the Marlboro Man and boosted series of Bumble Bee tuna by adding labels saying "Guaranteed not to turn pink in the can!"

Methods of studying vision in animals

- with Robert Yerkes, also founded Journal of Animal Behavior

Behavior: An Introduction to Comparative Psychology

- psychology could be completely grounded in objective measurements of events and physical human reactions

Kerplunk experiment

- with Harvey Carr
- named after the sound rats when they hit unexpected walls

Little Albert Experiment

- assisted by Rosalie Raynor, his wife
- conditioned fear in an otherwise normal child
- the 11-month-old boy "Albert" was exposed to numerous white fluffy stimuli (rat, rabbit, wool), initially no fear
- then exposed to white rat while banging a bar with a hammer to create a loud, scary noise and burning newspaper
- eventually, Albert reached with distress when exposed to any white fluffy stimuli, including Santa Claus mask
- criticized on ethical and procedural grounds
  - one child identified as potentially being "Little Albert" may have been born with serious cognitive impariment
  - Mary Cover Jones in a response experiment four years later used milk and crackers over two months, noted the presence of "degrees of toleration"
- Maren and Fanselow suggested that neuronal and synaptic plasticity may have been responsible for the results

### Max Wertheimer

Founded the gestalt school of philosophy, which emphasizes the whole as greater than its parts. Its central idea is the law of pragnanz, which predicts that the mind tends to connect broken lines in images to form shapes in its closure principle.

### Phillip Zimbardo

Stanford Prison Experiment

- Designed to study the effects of power dynamics in custodial situations
- Randomly assigned Stanford University students into "prisoners" and "guards"
- Guards could refer to prisoners only by their number, not name
- By the second day, prisoners began to rebel and guards implemented sadistic practices designed to degrade, humiliate, and dehumanize inmates
- Stopped after six days instead of two weeks when Christina Maslach raised ethical objections, sadism of the guards and growing depression in the prisoners
- "John Wayne"
- Many aspects questioned/disputed

The Lucifer Effect

- examines how seemingly good people can act in ways society deems evil
- extends on the events of the Stanford Prison Experiment
- compared those events to the abuses at Abu Ghraib

The Time Paradox

- explores how differences in how people understand time reflects on their role in society
- an experiment regarding children and marshmallows was the impetus
