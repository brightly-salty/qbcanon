### Berlin and Kay

Attempted to refute the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis with their research into a universalist theory of colors.

### Noam Chomsky

MIT linguist, controversial within the field and without. While a student under Zellig Harris, he developed a model differentiating between subconscious control, called competence, and actual use, which he called performance.

He theorized that a precise set of rules could predict all of the grammatically possible sentences in a language.

Languages with phrase structure which can be computed by Turing machines form the Type-0 tier of his grammar hierarchy.

Theorized about transformational-generative grammar.

He attacked behaviorist theories of language as a learned habit in his review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior. Contra Skinner, he thinks that children have an inherent language acquisition device.

He proposed that the abstract "deep structure" of sentences could be related to the "surface structure"

### Steven Pinker

A Canadian-American linguist and cognitive scientist. Contra Geoffrey Sampson, he believes that there is a natural language instinct.

### Benjamin Lee Whorf

A linguist best known for the controversial and doubted Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, which says that the use of language influences categories of thought. He supported the hypothesis by claiming that the Hopi perceive time differently from English speakers because their language deals with tense differently and with the refuted example of Inuit words for snow. The hypothesis was preceded and influenced by the Weltanschauung ideas of Wilhelm von Humboldt
