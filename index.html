<p>Welcome to the QB Canon site!</p>

<p>You may be asking yourself, "What's a canon?" Simply put, the canon is the set of topics which can reasonably be
    asked about in quizbowl, based on past frequency. For a better explanation of the concept and the surrounding
    controversy, see <a href="https://www.qbwiki.com/wiki/Canon">QBWiki</a>.</p>

<p>The numbers by the categories are the number of tossups and bonus that you can expect to see in each NAQT
    Invitational Series packet, as listed <a href="https://www.naqt.com/hs/distribution.jsp">here</a>. These are just
    meant as a guide to studying, and should not be taken as canon themselves.
</p>

<p>We have all of our content organized into four main categories:</p>

<ul>

    <li><a href="science/index.html">Science</a> (6.5 / 6.3)</li>

    <li><a href="history/index.html">History</a> (5.7 / 5.6)</li>

    <li><a href="arts-humanities/index.html">Arts and Humanities</a> (4.2 / 3.9)</li>

    <li><a href="literature/index.html">Literature</a> (4.0 / 3.8)</li>

</ul>
